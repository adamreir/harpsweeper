# Options

Harpsweeper incorporates a few options that allows adjustability of both the restrictions on the harp, and how you interact with the program. 

## Loop Sequence

The 'Loop sequence'-option informs Harpsweeper about whether the sequence will be played in a loop or not. Here is what it does:
 - When 'Loop sequence' is enabled, it checks if the first period can be played after the last, and vise versa.

 Here are two examples with loop options enabled and disabled. Notice how the 'Loop sequence'-option is toggled.

The 'Loop sequence' option is currently the only option that adjusts the restrictions that Harpsweeper imposes on the music.
