# Options

Harpsweeper incorporates a few options that allows adjustability of both the restrictions on the harp, and how you interact with the program. 

The program has two options that are self-explanatory, and not covered in detail: 
 - 'Dark mode' toggles between dark mode and light mode.
 - 'English' toggles between English and Norwegian Bokm√•l.

The rest of this file documents the following options: 
 - Loop sequence.
 - Reverse note order.
 - Note at bottom.

## Loop Sequence

The 'Loop sequence'-option informs Harpsweeper about whether the sequence will be played in a loop or not. Here is what it does:
 - When 'Loop sequence' is enabled, it checks if the first period can be played after the last, and vise versa.

 Here are two examples with the 'Loop sequence' option enabled and disabled.

The 'Loop sequence' option is currently the only option that adjusts the restrictions that Harpsweeper imposes on the music. 

## Adjusting the Note Layout

Harpsweeper lets you reorganize the order of the notes in the main screen. There are two options to to this: 

### Reverse Note Order 

This option does what it's name suggests: it reverses the order of the notes. Here is an example with the option toggled on and off: 

 Example 3a)               |  Example 3b)

### Place Note at Bottom

This option also adjust the order the notes are displayed by adjusting what note is placed on the bottom. Here is an example: 

 Example 3a)               |  Example 3b)
